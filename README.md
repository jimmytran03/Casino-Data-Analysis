Exploratory Data Analysis and Revenue Prediction for Casino Gaming

This is my very first full data science project! I started by collecting casino gaming data from the internet. Then, I used this data to understand how different parts of casino operations affect their income and to predict how much money they'll make.

I looked closely at the numbers to see patterns and how they relate to each other, like using a chart to show connections.

I created a  a Linear Regression model to guess the Total Gross Gaming Revenue based on the other numbers.

My model was extremely accurate! It could predict the casino's revenue almost perfectly, explaining nearly 100% of how the revenue changes.
